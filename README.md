This is a proof-of-concept, "it *kind of* works" type of EFI. This is my first attempt at *"hackintosh-ing"* something, and there are loads of things that could be removed and it would still work. **Tested only on Big Sur**, but with some changes probably would work on all versions starting with Snow Leopard.

# üë∑üèº WHAT DOESN'T WORK?
The list is real big, but here are some that absolutely do not work for whatever reason..:
- the ethernet port??? (weird..?)
- audio
- trackpad
- gpu acceleration (of course, 'cause Iris Xe)

## üñ•Ô∏è My hardware

|||
|-:|:-|
| **CPU** | Intel i3-1115G4 |
| **GPU** | Intel Iris X(e) |
| **RAM** | 8Gb of  2666Mhz |
| **Screen** | 1080p  |
| **SSD** | SSSTC CL1-8D256 256gb M.2 |
| **WiFi & Bluetooth** | Intel AX201 |

## ü§î Why?
The main driving force was boredom, but also because I wanted to do something with a laptop that I've been given, with which, to be honest, I absolutely have nothing to do with.
## üìù What now?
The first and easiest thing to get working will be the LAN port. After that I'll probably get the trackpad or audio working and wait around until somebody/Apple starts working on supporting Tiger Lake iGPUs. If even a year later, there's still no support in sight, I'll probably just try and hack together something, or maybe get an eGPU.
